<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Satnam Singh ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Unscroll mobile application (the "Service").</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data, including what we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>

<p>We respect your privacy. Unscroll does not collect or store any of your personal information, including your IP address. We do not sell or share your data with advertisers or third parties. By using the Service, you agree to this policy. Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>We don’t track, store, or access your data—period. We physically can’t. So even if Ariana Grande personally asked to see your data, we’d have nothing to show her.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>Unscroll may contain links to external websites that we do not operate. If you click on a third-party link, you will be redirected to their site. We strongly encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of any website you visit.</p>

<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Crash Data Collection</h2>

<p>Unscroll uses Crashlytics to collect crash data to improve app stability. For more information, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Changes to this Privacy Policy take effect immediately upon posting.</p>
